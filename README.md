# SurfTracker
iOS app to track surf conditions and forecasts, to help understand when each spot works best. This free, open source app is a personal project for me.

The goal is to have a fast, simple app which allows a surfer to rate the conditions at a spot that day, then the app will automatically log those details along with the surf forecasts from multiple sites. You can then easily see what conditions suit each spot best, and be make informed decisions about what spots will work best for upcoming conditions.

All data is private and only visible to the surfer, and spots can be custom locations.
